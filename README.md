# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Description:

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation OR Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (Assumption)

Description:

I did not get to do this part before the deadline, and since the other ones utilized other vulnerabilities, my assumption is that this one was session hijacking 
or cross site scripting (XSS).

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description:

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation OR Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (Assumption)

Description:

I did not get to do this part before the deadline, and since the other ones utilized other vulnerabilities, my assumption is that this one was session hijacking 
or cross site scripting (XSS).


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description:

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request FOrgery (CSRF)

Description:

## Notes

Due to this being assigned amidst multiple midterms, I did not find ample time to fully finish this assignment, and thus had to leave it incomplete. 
What little I did do, however, was very fun to experiment with and I hope to complete this assignment in my own time in the near future.
